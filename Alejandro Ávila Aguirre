## The function creates a matrix. Also, set the value of the matrix, get the value of the vector, set the value of solve, and get the value of solve

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
        s <- NULL
        set <- function(y) {
                x <<- y
                s <<- NULL
        }
        get <- function() x
        setsolve <- function(solve) s <<- solve
        getsolve <- function() s
        list(set = set, get = get,
             setsolve = setsolve,
             getsolve = getsolve)
}


## It computes the inverse of the special matrix created, and returned  by MakeCacheMatrix. If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then the cacheSolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        s <- x$getsolve()
        if(!is.null(s)) {
                message("getting cached data")
                return(s)
        }
        data <- x$get()
        s <- solve(data, ...)
        x$setsolve(s)
        s
}
